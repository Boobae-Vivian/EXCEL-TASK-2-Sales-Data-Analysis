# Sales Data Analysis

## INTRODUCTION
This is an Excel task focused on analyzing a robust sales dataset comprising 700 rows and 13 columns. Our goal is to extract key insights by addressing various questions related to total revenue, profit, and average sales metrics. Leveraging the power of data analytics, we aim to provide a detailed understanding of the extensive sales landscape, identifying patterns and deriving actionable conclusions. Throughout this exploration, we'll make sense of the sales data, assess the performance of different products and segments, and answer critical questions about high-selling regions and well-performing products in specific areas. Let's collaboratively dive into the 700 rows and 13 columns of information to uncover valuable insights about our sales performance.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
In the realm of sales data analysis, a pressing challenge emerges as we endeavor to derive comprehensive insights from the provided dataset. The scope of this task involves determining fundamental metrics such as:
- Total revenue and profit generated
- Average revenue and units sold for every order
- Total discounts given
- Overall number of sales recorded
- The highest profit generated
- Creating a strategic '**Sales Range**' column to return '**high**' if the sales value is above average otherwise '**low**'
- Average revenue from 'Paseo' sales
- The count of sales in the Government and Midmarket segments
- The total revenue from 'Montana' sales in Canada
- The country, segment, and month where the highest units of goods were sold
- The total profit specifically made in the month of December.

## SKILLS AND CONCEPTS DEMOSTRATED

## ANALYSIS, RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

### Total Revenue and Profit Generated
The total revenue is calculated by summing the values in the sales column, represented by column letter J, spanning from row numbers 2 to 701. The formula used is SUM(J2:J701), yielding a total revenue of $127,931,598.50.
Similarly, the total profit is determined in the same manner, utilizing the profit column as letter K and row numbers ranging from 2 to 701. The formula employed is SUM(K2:K701), resulting in a total profit of $168,937,02.3.
Hence the computed results are as follows:
- Total revenue: $127,931,598.50
- Total profit: $168,937,02.3
